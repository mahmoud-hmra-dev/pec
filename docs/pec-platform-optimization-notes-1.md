# PEC Platform Optimization Notes — 1

The following list consolidates the requested enhancements for the PEC platform. Each bullet captures an actionable improvement or clarification gathered from stakeholder feedback.

- Provide an option to delete a profile.
- Append an asterisk (`*`) next to every required form field.
- Update the Patients section so that only the patient identifier is required; remove the personal information fields that are currently mandatory.
- Allow the data entry section to be customized for each study individually.
- Enable the project coordinator to create nurse accounts (or send requests for their creation); consider elevating access to an admin-level role because the current sub-admin role is too limited.
- When entering personnel details, require only the essential study information (name, surname, email, position); keep all other attributes (CV, phone number, etc.) optional.
- When creating a program (study by client), permit entry of comprehensive contact information for the global study manager, assistant manager, finance contact, and other roles, including email and title (phone optional).
- Introduce an “Other” title option so that custom titles can be specified without predefining them in the service type catalog.
- Associate contacts with individual programs instead of clients, since each program maintains its own contact list.
- In the service provider section, support both adding and deleting service types, and investigate the meaning of the “code” and “is one” columns in the table.
- Hide the Countries section from the interface while retaining the ability to assign countries to studies and personnel.
- Present all time-related sections in a calendar view (e.g., each patient should have a personal calendar).
- Clarify the purpose and usage of the Questions section.
- Consolidate the Calls and Visits sections into a single area with a simple status indicator (to do, pending, done).
